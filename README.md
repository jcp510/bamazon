# bamazon
This app is a mock-up of an Amazon-like storefront built with MySQL and Node.js.  It is a command line interface app that takes in orders from customers and adjusts inventory accordingly.


This project is currently under construction.  I encountered and got stuck in an error that prevented the bamazonCustomer.js file from successfully running in the terminal.  Research into this error seems to be pointing to use of reserved words within the node modules and suggest the use of a transpiler such as babel.
